        <h1>What is Ethereum?</h1>
        <!-- <h2> text taken from https://ethereum.org/ -->
        <h2>Ethereum is a decentralized platform for applications that run exactly as programmed without any chance of fraud,
            censorship or third-party interference.</h2>
        <hr>


        <h3>Created in 2017</h3>
        <!-- <p> text taken from https://ethereum.org/ -->
        <p>Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without
            any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference. These apps run on a custom built
            blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the
            ownership of property. This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move
            funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other
            things that have not been invented yet, all without a middle man or counterparty risk. The project was bootstrapped
            via an ether presale in August 2014 by fans all around the world. It is developed by the Ethereum Foundation,
            a Swiss nonprofit, with contributions from great minds across the globe.</p>

            <!-- <p> text taken from https://ethereum.org/ -->
            <p>The Ethereum Wallet is a gateway to decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows you to hold
                and secure ether and other crypto-assets built on Ethereum, as well as write, deploy and use smart contracts.

        <div class="accordianpanel">
            <!-- <p> text taken from https://www.bitmart.co.za/en/what-is-ethereum/ -->
            <p>On traditional server architectures, every application has to set up its own servers that run their own code
                in isolated silos, making sharing of data hard. If a single app is compromised or goes offline, many users
                and other apps are affected. On a blockchain, anyone can set up a node that replicates the necessary data
                for all nodes to reach an agreement and be compensated by users and app developers. This allows user data
                to remain private and apps to be decentralized like the Internet was supposed to work.

            <p>Vitalik Buterin, a programmer from Toronto, first grew interested in bitcoin in 2011. Buterin learned about Bitcoin
                when he was 17, and soon after (in 2012) won the Bronze Medal at the International Olympiads in Informatics.
                He co-founded the online news website Bitcoin Magazine in the same year, writing hundreds of articles on
                the cryptocurrency world. He went on to code for the privacy-minded Dark Wallet and the marketplace Egora.
                After Buterin unveiled the Ethereum white paper, other developers participated in the project. The team behind
                Ethereum is very smart. I always look up the people that are behind a project before investing and Ethereum
                has 100% of my confidence.

        <h3>A Strong Investment</h3>
        <p>The main driving force behind Ethereum's new popularity is from the investment community. When the potential value
            of Ethereum was discovered, investors began purchasing large quantitys of Ethereum driving the price up. Ethereum
            is still an extremely sought after cryptocurrency with high investment potential. Have a look at the price chart
            to view just how much Ethereum has risen in the past few years.</p>

        <h1>Investing in Ethereum</h1>
        <h2>Given the sudden rise in Ethereums value it's no wonder people are clammoring to invest in the cryptocurrency.</h2>

        <h3>A new venture</h3>
        <!-- <p> text taken from https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-invest-in-ethereum-200181392 -->
        <p>Ethereum is also alot more volatile than Bitcoin currently. However, this is probably as a result of its infancy
            status. Traders are less capable of dealing with its gyrations as they have not had the opportunity to study
            it over the long term. Many crptocurrency traders tend to rely on forex signals and even then the direction is
            hard to judge. Hence, if you are a trader that is looking to make a quick profit on the volatile moves of Ether,
            then it could be more difficult to give you clear guidance on the short term movements. However, from the perspective
            of an investment decision, the allure of Ethereum cannot be ignored. Like those investors who buy gold as a store
            of value, a crypto currency will serve the same purpose.</p>

        <h1> Ethereum Blockchain</h1>
        <!-- The three <p> sections below are taken from https://www.coindesk.com/information/how-ethereum-works/ -->
        <p>The structure of the ethereum blockchain is very similar to bitcoin's, in that it is a shared record of the entire
            transaction history. Every node on the network stores a copy of this history. The big difference with ethereum
            is that its nodes store the most recent state of each smart contract, in addition to all of the ether transactions.
            (This is much more complicated than described, but the text below should help you get your feet wet.)</p>

        <p>For each ethereum application, the network needs to keep track of the 'state', or the current information of all
            of these applications, including each user's balance, all the smart contract code and where it's all stored.
            Bitcoin uses unspent transaction outputs to track who has how much bitcoin. While it sounds more complex, the
            idea is fairly simple. Every time a bitcoin transaction is made, the network 'breaks' the total amount as if
            it was paper money, issuing back bitcoins in a way that makes the data behave similarly to physical coins or
            change. </p>

        <p>To make future transactions, the bitcoin network must add up all your pieces of change, which are classed as either
            'spent' or 'unspent'. Ethereum, on the other hand, uses accounts. Like bank account funds, ether tokens appear
            in a wallet, and can be ported (so to speak) to another account. Funds are always somewhere, yet don’t have what
            you might call a continued relationship.</p>
